     <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
     <p>I do not have any particular job that i'd like to pursue however, something along the lines of IT manager sounds perfect for me. A link i found was a job listing of IT manager for Catch Of The Day's supply chain:
     </p>
     <p><big><b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50592392?type=standout#searchRequestToken=ec676ec0-4a95-434f-b19e-2e4c93f1f0f5" target="_blank"><i>IT Manager</i></a></b></big></p>
     <p>
       The role of an IT manager is to be responsible for the overall performance of a business's electronic networks and lead the IT department to fulfill the organizationâ€™s information systems requirements. This means looking after a company's in-house computer networks may including selecting the hardware and software that is needed for the network, or looking at other technology that can improve the business's productivity.</p>
     <br>
     <p>This role was appealing to me as on of the key responsibilites is to "Experiment in leading technologies to drive innovation across the corporate areas" (Catch.com.au Pty Ltd, seek.com.au). This is very desirable for me as i am curious of ways in which new technology can make businesses much more productive.
     </p>
     <p><big><b>Skills and Qualifications:</b></big></p>
     <p>The overall skills listed by the job post outlines things like good team leadership, clear comunication and most importantly, depth in knowledge of IT solutions. Currently i am still learning the latter and believe i have clear communication and teamwork abilities. However, i hope to aqquire these skills when completing my degree and also via experiance in the workplace.</p>
