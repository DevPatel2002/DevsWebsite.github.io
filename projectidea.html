   <h2>Task Tracker</h2>
   <p>Technology has fasinated me by the way it has changed how we live and work. My passion with IT is to find the next big thing that will further excel the way we work. Hence, i would like to make a program which can help businesses and companies set their desired goal and be able to use a program which can help them track their progress without the need of analysing complex data and other variables which cause confusion and waste time.</p>

   <p>At June 30 2019 there were 2,375,753 actively trading businesses in the Australian economy(abs.gov.au, 2019). These businesses rely on KPIs to track their company's performance. This makes me wonder, what if there was a program that a manager or owner can have in their pocket as an application to check on their company's performace whenever they desire.Having the convenience of being able to see a graph on your phone displaying current accomplishments and goals of a business on a simple graph on a phone or laptop can be very usfull to many businesses no matter their size.</p>

   <p><b>Detailed Description:</b></p>
   <p>This program will work by having complex algorithms which can translate the data inputted by the business. Simple inputs will frequently need to be inputted for example, profit made, stock availability etc. This program will then output exactly how the business is progressing and output a easy to read infographic that can be interpreted by anyone. The program can also be used as a monitoring system for employees and staff. if all business activities are digitalised and tracked by the program it can be an all in one solution for many businesses. This apps aim to streamline workflow and centralize communication so that you can spend more time actually working and less time figuring out what everyone needs to do. It is aimed to be a easy-to-use platform that can take care of your invoicing, expense tracking, receipt scanning, and more. With the advantages of such a program comes disadvantages like security issues that will need to be thoroughly examined before valuable data can be entered on the application. Another setback can be caused if a business is not fully digitalised and may have card copies of data that can be very time consuming and inconvenient to input in the program.</p>

   <p>The tools and technology needed for this sort of program or application would just be a good platform to code the actual program on and skilled knowledge of programming and mathematical algorithms to be able to successfully make a easy-to-use application.</p>

   <p>If this became successful, it will once again make work much more eaiser and convenient. it should be a much more effiecent way of reflecting on a businesses performace and progression.</p>
